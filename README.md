So far this is only tested on Windows.
Using PyEnv-Win

Should work with Pyenv on Linux as well - getting to that in the future.

Meanwhile linux users should be able to enter the folder
and run `python -m venv dnscheck-venv && source dnscheck-venv/bin/activate`
And after that do: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
